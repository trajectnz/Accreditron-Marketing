  <h2>Information Ownership</h2>
  <p>Who owns the information in Accreditron? Is a question we get asked a lot. This document is our plain-english response to that question.</p>

  <h3>So who owns the information?</h3>
  <p>When an organisation uploads information to Accreditron, they retain full ownership and control of that information. Accreditron doesn't hold any claim to that information. This means we will not use any of your organisation's information without your approval or command.</p>

  <p>Accreditron is a communication tool - this means we:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure your information is stored securely</li>
    <li>Ensure other users and organisations cannot access your information without permission</li>
    <li>Ensure Accreditron the system is running correctly, which may include having to access your information when debugging or delivering our services. If we need to use your information for any other purposes, we will notify you.</li>
    <li>Clearly communicate who can access information when your organisation shares it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As an organisation using Accreditron, your responsibilities are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that the right individuals have access to your organisation on Accreditron</li>
    <li>Ensure that you're comfortable sending the information that you're sending</li>
    <li>Ensure that the organisation who's receiving the information will use it as you deem fit. We take no responsibility to what organisations do with information which you shared with them through Accreditron.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Removal of information</h3>
  <p>If you wish to remove your organisation's information from Accreditron, please contact support@accreditron.com and we will do so. However please note that we can only remove information that is controlled by your organisation.</p>

  <p>For example, another organisation has published a report about your organisation which you would like removed. That report is owned by the other organisation, so we cannot remove that report without permission from the other organisation.</p>

  <p>Other than in the case of abuse or misuse of the system, Accreditron will cooperate as a neutral party when resolving any disputes between organisations using Accreditron.</p>
