    <h1><strong>Roadmap</strong></h1>
    <p>Our roadmap is regularly updated as tasks are completed and reprioritised, and therefore things may change at any time. Items are prioritised top-to-bottom and then split into three columns. 'Current' represents what we are working on now, 'Near Term' is what we plan to work on next, and 'Future' represents future goals.</p>
