      <p>Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Act, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information.  Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.</p>
      <p>In respect of a request for correction, if we think the correction is reasonable and we are reasonably able to change the personal information, we will make the correction.  If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.</p>
      <p>If you want to exercise either of the above rights, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@accreditron.com" >hello@accreditron.com</a>.  Your email should provide evidence of who you are and set out the details of your request (e.g. the personal information, or the correction, that you are requesting).</p>
      <p>We may charge you our reasonable costs of providing to you copies of your personal information or correcting that information.</p>
