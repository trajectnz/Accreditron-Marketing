    <h2><strong>Kia Ora!</strong>
    <br> Here's our future roadmap.</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 600px;">Our roadmap is regularly updated as tasks are completed and reprioritised, and therefore things may change at any time. Items are prioritised top-to-bottom and then split into three columns. 'Current' represents what we are working on now, 'Near Term' is what we plan to work on next, and 'Future' represents future gaols.</p>
