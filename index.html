	<h2><strong>Request information,</strong><br> without creating duplicated work</h2>

	<hr>
	<div>
		<p>Providers are currently asked 50-80% of the same questions by different teams within government, creating duplicated work for everybody.   
		<br><br>
		Information is requested through emails and word templates, meaning there’s no way to re-use this information.</p>

		<p>Accreditron saves your information for the future - so if you get asked a question again, we just auto-fill in your previous answer for review.
		<br><br>
		We’ve also re-written the questions to be clear and straighforward, to make processess painless.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Currently its a challenge to share basic information about a provider among teams within government. For example during an RFP it’s easier to ask the provider if they’re accredited - rather than finding out internally.  
		<br><br>
		Government workers don’t see a holistic overview of an organisation, and their interactions with government.</p>

		<p>The provider profile contains basic information about a provider:  services (funded and unfunded), what teams they’re working with, reports (such as Accreditaiton) and other basic details.
		<br><br>
		  It’s a collaborative document - information is updated by both the provider, and government staff.</p>

		<h2>A better view of the social sector</h2>
		<p>Social sector information is currently scattered among teams and systems, each piece only giving part of the picture. Accreditron collects data holistically, aiming to show all aspects of a social sector organisation - not just the aspects that government traditionally cares about.</p>

		<p>This information will help answer big questions about the social sector, such as finding gaps in services for New Zealand communities.</p>

		<h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
		<p>As a tool for government, Accreditron has to undertake a thorough security review - so you can be sure data is secure. We take data privacy very seriously - your information is yours. We’re always transparent about where information is going, and for what purpose. </p>
